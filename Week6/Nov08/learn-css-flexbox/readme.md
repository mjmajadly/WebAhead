## The Challenge

The aim of this challenge is to learn how to improve the layout and spacing of unstyled HTML, with CSS.

Your task is to emulate the single column layout and spacing of the blog posts shown in the GIF above. Remember:

- Start with too much white space
- You donâ€™t have to fill the whole screen
- Avoid ambiguous spacing

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and open `index.html` in your web browser to view the unstyled list of blog posts. Open `style.css` and style away! (but don't edit the `index.html`!)

## Stretch goal

Add a media query to `style.css` to create a two
column layout for screens wider than 800px.
