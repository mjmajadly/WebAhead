web applications. The Objective of this challenge is to create one both
appealing to the eye yet accessible.


## Learning Outcomes

* Learn to use transitions and transformations
* Learn to control the focus of HTML Elements

## Starting Point
* `git clone` the repository
*  run `npm install`
*  start the project by running `npm start`
*  There are 3 files you need to work on **style.css, index.js and index.html**


## Hints

* Try using the [CSS
  transform](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/) rule to move the app drawer element
```css
transform: scale | translate | rotate
```

* Also consider [ transitioning
  ](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) any css transformation so the effect isn't
  instantaneous

* My solution is on the `solution branch` please do not check this till the
  end of the workshop.

## Stretch Goals

  files
