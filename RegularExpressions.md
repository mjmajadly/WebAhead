## Regular Expressions
1. What is regex? Why would I use it? What are some examples of common regex usage?
2. Research:
  + How to use regex
    + (basic) pattern creation and repetitions
    + (advanced) groups
  + Find and use on-line tools such as [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
2. Create a code snippet using regex such as (for example) email validator:
+ us3r1@foundersandcoders.com
  + user must start with an alphabetical character;
  + user can contain also other characters (which ones?);
  + site and user are always separated by a snail/small duck/AT symbol (@);
  + site is always done with at least 3 alphabetical characters, a dot and at least 2 more alphabetical characters
